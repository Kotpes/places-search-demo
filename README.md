## Set up
- Clone this repo, `cd` in and run `yarn && yarn start` to install dependencies and start the development server. Application will open in browser at `localhost:3000`
- To get `flowtype` working with your IDE, you might need to have it installed globally `npm install flow-bin -g`

### Development notes
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to keep time spent on tooling minimal
- I'm using [css modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) fro styles encapsulation. Stylesheet file has to be named `*.module.css` to get parsed correctly.
- [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) is used for code splitting
